# todoapp - project for practice that I made 2 month earlier through youtube video.
I replicated the project by doing it all over without watching the solution.

The good thing is that I had no problems planning the steps of the project and feel much more confident for problem solving,
however during the coding I had several syntax or spelling mistakes that took me away more than an hour)

Finally i was able to complete the project slowly on a rainy sunday afternoon.
